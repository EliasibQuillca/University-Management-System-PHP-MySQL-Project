## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `insertAttendance` inside the `Admin` class. It inserts attendance records for students into the `attn` table for a given date.

## Example Usage
```php
$admin = new Admin();
$cur_date = "2021-10-01";
$atten = [
    1 => "present",
    2 => "absent",
    3 => "present"
];
$result = $admin->insertAttendance($cur_date, $atten);
echo $result; // Output: true
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$cur_date` (string): The current date for which attendance is being recorded.
- `$atten` (array): An associative array with student `st_id` as keys and attendance values (`present` or `absent`) as values.
___
### Flow
1. The method first checks if attendance records already exist for the given date by querying the `attn` table for distinct dates.
2. If attendance records already exist for the given date, the method returns `false`.
3. If attendance records do not exist for the given date, the method prepares an `INSERT` query to insert attendance records into the `attn` table.
4. The method then iterates over the `$atten` array and binds the student ID, attendance value, and date to the prepared statement.
5. The method executes the prepared statement for each student and attendance record.
6. If any execution fails, the method returns `false`.
7. If all executions are successful, the method returns `true`.
___
### Outputs
- The method returns `true` if the insertion of attendance records is successful.
- The method returns `false` if attendance records already exist for the given date or if any execution of the prepared statement fails.
