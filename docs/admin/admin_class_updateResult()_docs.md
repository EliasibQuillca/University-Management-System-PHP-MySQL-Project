## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `updateResult` that updates the marks of a student for specific subjects and semester in a database table called `result`. It takes the student ID, an associative array of subjects and their corresponding marks, and the semester as inputs. The method executes an SQL query to update the marks for each subject and returns true if all updates are successful, and false otherwise.

## Example Usage
```php
$admin = new Admin();
$studentId = 1;
$subjects = array(
    'Math' => 90,
    'Science' => 85,
    'English' => 95
);
$semester = 1;

$result = $admin->updateResult($studentId, $subjects, $semester);

if ($result) {
    echo "Marks updated successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Failed to update marks.";
}
```
