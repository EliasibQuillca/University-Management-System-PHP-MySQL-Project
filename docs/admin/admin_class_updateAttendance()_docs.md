## Summary
This code snippet is a method called `updateAttendance` that updates attendance records for students in the `attn` table for a given date and attendance values.

## Example Usage
```php
$admin = new Admin();
$date = "2021-10-01";
$attendance = [
    1 => "present",
    2 => "absent",
    3 => "present"
];
$result = $admin->updateAttendance($date, $attendance);
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$date` (string): The date for which attendance records are being updated.
- `$atten` (array): An associative array with student `st_id` as keys and updated attendance values (`present` or `absent`) as values.
___
### Flow
1. The method establishes a database connection.
2. It iterates over each student in the `$atten` array.
3. For each student, it prepares an SQL query to update the attendance in the `attn` table.
4. The student's attendance value, student ID, and date are bound as parameters to the prepared statement.
5. The prepared statement is executed.
6. If the execution is successful for all students, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
___
### Outputs
- `true` if the update is successful.
- `false` if there is a database error or if the update fails.
