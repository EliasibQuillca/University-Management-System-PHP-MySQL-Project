## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `adminLogin` in the `Admin` class. It attempts to log in an admin user by checking the provided username and password against the 'admin' table in the database. If the credentials match, the method starts a session and stores the admin login information.

## Example Usage
```php
$admin = new Admin();
$loggedIn = $admin->adminLogin('admin', 'password');
if ($loggedIn) {
    echo "Admin logged in successfully.";
} else {
    echo "Invalid username or password.";
}
```

### Flow
1. The method prepares an SQL query to select the admin's id and username from the 'admin' table where the provided username and password match.
2. It establishes a database connection by calling the `connect` method from the parent class.
3. The method binds the `$username` and `$password` parameters to the prepared statement.
4. It executes the query and fetches the result as an associative array.
5. The method checks the row count to determine if the login is successful.
6. If the row count is 1, the method starts a session and stores the admin login information.
7. If any database error occurs, it is logged.
8. The method returns `true` if the login is successful; otherwise, it returns `false`.
