## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `viewCgpa` within the `Admin` class. It retrieves the CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) for a specific student from the `result` table in the database. The method uses a parameterized SQL query to prevent SQL injection and handles any exceptions that may occur during the database operation.

## Example Usage
```php
$admin = new Admin();
$studentId = 123;
$result = $admin->viewCgpa($studentId);
if ($result) {
    // Process the CGPA data
    // ...
} else {
    // Handle the case when no data is found or an error occurs
    // ...
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `$studentId` (integer): The ID of the student for whom the CGPA is to be retrieved.
___
### Flow
1. Prepare the SQL query with a parameterized statement to select all rows from the `result` table where the `st_id` column matches the provided `$studentId`.
2. Create a PDO statement by calling the `prepare` method on the database connection obtained from the `parent::connect()` method.
3. Bind the `$studentId` parameter to the prepared statement using the `bindParam` method to prevent SQL injection.
4. Execute the prepared statement using the `execute` method.
5. Fetch all the rows from the result set using the `fetchAll` method and store the result in the `$result` variable.
6. Check if the result contains any data by comparing the count of rows in the result array with zero.
7. If the result contains data, return the result array.
8. If an exception occurs during the database operation, catch the `PDOException` and log the error message to the error log using the `error_log` function.
9. Return `false` to indicate that no data is found or an error occurred.
___
### Outputs
- The method returns the query result as an associative array if data is found.
- If no data is found or an error occurs, the method returns `false`.
